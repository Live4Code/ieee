We build this hardware-software co-design platform from scratch based on our experience with the requirements of edge computing research problems.</p>\n<p>HydraOne is a full-stack platform for CAV including power system, chassis system, computing system, and communication system. We provides several out-of-the-box application demos for CAVs on HydraOne, which will help researchers and students fully understand the platform and take advantage of it to conduct research experiments.</p>\n<p>HydraOne is an open platform, in addition to the development model we provide, users can add new hardware/software resources on HydraOne, or access, analyze, and customize any resources on HydraOne.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thecarlab.org/hydraone/\">https://thecarlab.org/hydraone/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Projects","meta_title":"Projects | IEEE Technical Committee on Electric and Autonomous Vehicles","meta_description":"Featured Projects: HydraOne"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"26e2616a-0d81-5457-824c-5d66c4b42ff0"}}}
