## Autonomous driving platforms

### NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation

NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation™ is an open, scalable, autonomous vehicle validation platform that enables a virtual test fleet in the data center. Each node is comprised of a powerful GPU server directly coupled with another server hosting the on-board AI computer of an autonomous vehicle.

### Microsoft AirSim

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine (we now also have an experimental Unity release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment.
